# How-to guides

These guides will walk you through steps of using Chisel through its operations
life cycle.

## Installation

Installation follows a broadly similar pattern on all architectures, and you
can choose to install the pre-built binary, Snap or build it from the source by
yourself.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

install-chisel
```

## Creating a chiselled Docker image

Since Chisel can produce a minimal root file system, using it in Docker images
has lots of value.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

create-chiselled-docker-image
```
