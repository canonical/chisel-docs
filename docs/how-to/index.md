# How-to guides

These guides will walk you through steps of using Chisel through its operations
life cycle.

## Installation

Installation follows a broadly similar pattern on all architectures, and you
can choose to install the pre-built binary, Snap or build it from the source by
yourself.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

install-chisel
```

## Creating a chiseled container image

Chiseled file systems are ideal for creating minimal and distroless-like
container images.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

use-chisel-in-dockerfile
```

## Ubuntu Pro

Chisel supports fetching and installing {{ubuntu_pro}} package slices from the ESM
archives. These guides provide more hands-on information on how to use Chisel
with Ubuntu Pro.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

install-pro-package-slices
```

## Creating a slice definition

Creating slice definitions can be simple and fun. Make sure to follow the best
practices.
